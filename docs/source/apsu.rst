APS-U
=====

The APS Upgrade involves replacing the whole storage ring currently operating at 7 GeV with a new storage ring using a multi-bend achromat lattice operating at 6 GeV. The stored current will be 200 mA compared to the current 100 mA. The change of the storage ring is to generate extremely small emittance beams. 

The current double bend APS lattice is being replaced by a new 7 bend achromat lattice. This new lattice is aligned in the existing storage ring enclosure. The location of the ID beamline has been fixed based on the layout. However, this change in lattice results in a displacement to the BM source.
